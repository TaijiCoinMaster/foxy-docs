## How to configure Foxy-Proxy

Foxy-Proxy looks for a file named `config.yaml` in the current directory it is run from.
If no such file is found it will look for it in `<HOMEDIR>/.config/foxy-proxy/config.yaml`.

If no config file can be found, an example config file is created for you in `<HOMEDIR>/.config/foxy-proxy/config.yaml`.

To store statistics Foxy-Proxy uses a SQLite database located in `<HOMEDIR>/.config/foxy-proxy/db.sqlite` by default.

## Autostart Foxy-Proxy on boot

### Windows

!!! info
    The following steps for Windows will start the proxy on login, not boot

1. Create a `.bat` file which contains the following lines:
```
cls
:start
call foxy-proxy
goto start
```

2. Create a shortcut to that bat file and move it into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

### Linux

1. Install pm2:
```
npm i -g pm2
```

2. Start the proxy through pm2:
```
pm2 start foxy-proxy
```

3. Save the current running configuration and create a startup cmd:
```
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

4. Depending on if you are `root` the `pm2 startup` command either runs directly or outputs a sudo command you will need to execute.

## Per Miner maxScanTime

To allow fine granular control each miner which supports urls instead of simple ip:port can subscribe to their own maxScanTime. To do so, just append the preferred maxScanTime in seconds to the url, like so: `http://localhost:12345/signa-bhd/25`. That would result in that miner setting its `maxScanTime` to 25 seconds.

## Configuration Options

The config file currently consists of these config options:

- `proxies`: Array of proxy config objects, see below (**required**)
    - `name`: The name of the proxy, must be unique (**required**)

    - `minerColor`: Use the defined hex string as color for this proxies's miner names in logs. eg `'#e2ad58'`
    - `minerOfflineMinutes`: Report miners offline after at least this amount of minutes. Defaults to 5.
    - `minerOfflineBlocks`: Report miners offline after at least this amount of blocks. Defaults to 2.
    - `hideUpstreamName`: Set to true to hide the upstreams name in logs. Useful for single upstream proxies.
    - `humanizeDeadlines`: Set to true to display deadlines in the cli in a human readable format (2d 02:46:13).
