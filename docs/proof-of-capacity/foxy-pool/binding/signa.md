### To bind to the SIGNA Foxy-Pool just follow these steps:

=== "Classic wallet"

    1. Open your SIGNA wallet and let it sync till it is on the current height.
    2. Log into it with your plotter id passphrase:

        ![SIGNA Login](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-bind-1.png){: loading=lazy }

    3. If you do not own any SIGNA, you can use the faucet available on the [pools Web UI](https://signa.foxypool.io/faucet) to get a little SIGNA to be able to bind to the pool.
    4. Select the Setting drop down at the top right corner and click `Reward Assignment`:

    5. In the modal appearing enter the pools address to bind to in the `Recipient` field.
    6. Use the standard fee or if you already have enough SIGNA you can use a higher fee for faster confirms as well.
    7. Enter your plotterId passphrase in the `Passphrase` field. If you selected "Remember passphrase during session" during login, this step is optional.

    8. Confirm the Binding via the `Set Reward Recipient` button.

=== "Phoenix wallet"

    1. Open your Phoenix wallet and log in / import your plotter id via your plotter id passphrase:

        ![SIGNA Import](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-phoenix-bind-1.png){: loading=lazy }

    2. Confirm the shown ID matches your plotter id:

        ![SIGNA Import Confirmation](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-phoenix-bind-2.png){: loading=lazy }

    3. Finally setup a pin to log into the account without requiring the plotter id passphrase every time:

        ![SIGNA Import Pin](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-phoenix-bind-3.png){: loading=lazy }

    4. Once logged into the wallet select "Mining > Reward Assignment" in the left sidebar:

        ![SIGNA Open Reward Assignment](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-phoenix-bind-4.png){: loading=lazy }

    5. If you do not own any SIGNA, you can use the faucet available on the [pools Web UI](https://signa.foxypool.io/faucet) to get a little SIGNA to be able to bind to the pool.
    6. Enter the pools address to bind to in the `Recipient` field.
    7. Use the standard fee or if you already have enough SIGNA you can use a higher fee for faster confirms as well.
    8. Enter your pin from step 3 in the `PIN` field.

        ![SIGNA Bind to](../../../assets/img/binding/signa-phoenix-bind-5.png){: loading=lazy }
